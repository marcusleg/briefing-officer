# Architecture Decisions

# Use types generated by Prisma where possible.

We choose to accept tight coupling with the database schema to eliminate the  
need for a translation layer between database objects and application-specific
types, resulting in less code.

# Pass complete Prisma objects to functions rather than individual properties.

This improves maintainability and future-proofs the code by avoiding the need to
update function signatures when new properties are needed. It also reduces
coupling between functions and specific object properties, making the code more
flexible and easier to modify.
